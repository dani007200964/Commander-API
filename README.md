# Commander API

**Version 1.0.0**

 The __Commander API__ is a __C API__ to interpret character-based commands and map them to their functions easily. It is designed mainly to work with low memory capacity devices, for example, __small ARM devices or some embedded stuff__.



## Installation

Installation is easy. Just add __interpreter.h__, and __interpreter.c__ files to your project.

## Usage

__1.__

First, you have to add the two files to your project. Than you have to create the instruction data in the __interpreter.c__ file under the following comment:

```
//  +----  Create instruction data for the API  ----+
//  |                                               |
//  |       This is where you have to add           |
//  |               your commands!                  |
//  |                                               |
//  +-----------------------------------------------+

create_instruction_data(stop, "basic stop command");
```

Use the __create_instruction_data()__ macro to add your commands to the interpreter like above. You have to do this for every instruction that you want to add. The first argument is the exact command name( this will be the exact command name! ), and the second one is a short description. Note that the first argument __must not have any quotes before and after thet!__

__2.__

The next step is to match the functions to your commands. You have to do it in the interpreter.c file, in the init_interpreter() function, under the following comment:

```
//  +----  Match instruction to it's function   ----+
//  |                                               |
//  |       This is where you have to match         |
//  |       every instruction name to it's          |
//  |                   function.                   |
//  |                                               |
//  +-----------------------------------------------+
    add_instruction(stop, stop_func);
```

Use the __add_instruction()__ macro to match the name and the associated function like above. You have to do this for every instruction that you have added previously. The first argument is the instruction name __exactly like the previous step__, the second argument is the function that you want to use when this command gets executed. This function has to be a __void__ return type with two arguments. The first argument is a __char*__ type and the second one is a very ugly __int(*resp_fn)(const char*, ...)__ type. I know that it looks scary, but it can be very handy, and you have to just copy the example function to create a new one.

__3.__

The next thing you have to do is to specify the number of commands you have been added. It can be done in the __interpreter.h__ file under the following comment:

```
//  +----  Set the correct values  ----+
//  |                                  |
//  |     NUM_OF_API_FUNCS value has   |
//  |           to be exact!           |
//  |                                  |
//  +----------------------------------+

#define NUM_OF_API_FUNCS  4
```

Modify the __NUM_OF_API_FUNCS__ value to the right number unless __the program will crash!__

__4.__

The last thing you have to do is to actually create your functions. A simple example function can be like this:

```
void stop_func(char *args, int(*resp_fn)(const char*, ...))
{
    printf("STOP!\r\n");
    printf("Args: %s\r\n", args);

    //  Always check the response function channel!
    //  If it's a NULL pointer you can't use it,
    //  because itt will crash your porgram!
    if( resp_fn != NULL ){

        resp_fn( "Wow! Magic!!!!\r\n" );

    }
}
```

The example function above shows the function of the response function. The interpreter can send messages back to the sender channel. If not used, just pass a __null__ pointer to it.

## How it works, why to use?
 The library does __not use any malloc or dynamic memory,__ so it is suitable for embedded platforms. The module creates a balanced binary tree by alphabetical order in initialization time. The memory requirement of this tree can be calculated by compile-time if we know how many instructions we have. This is why you must configure __NUM_OF_API_FUNCS__ symbol correctly! To save some RAM, the module uses __char**__ datatypes to reference the commands and the descriptions stored in program memory.To create the balanced tree it is a bit more compute hungry than the old strcmp method, but the tree method will boost significantly the speed in search time, so I think it's worth it. In the worst case it finds a command in O*log2(N). That means it can find a command(if it exists) in a __1024__ element long command list under __10__ search steps.
