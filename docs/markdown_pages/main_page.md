__Version V2.1.0__

Commander-API is a simple-to-use parser library, and you can easily use it to process character-based commands and link them to a specified function. It is designed mainly to work with low memory capacity devices, for example, __small ARM or AVR processors__.

__Changes in V2.1.X__

* Response function changed to __Stream__ type. This way it supports almost anything in the Arduino ecosystem.
I believe it supports all platforms now.
* Pipe support enabled. To use it, check out the @ref what_is_piping "pipes guide".
* AVR PROGMEM support. This library was very resource-hungry in the previous versions of the AVR platform.
Strings are stored in the RAM area by default in the AVR controllers. There is a macro called PROGMEM to
store them in the FLASH, but you can't access them like a regular string. For this reason, a compatibility
layer was added inside Commander-API.
* Internal debug and status messages are automatically stored in PROGMEM on AVR. The overall memory consumption
reduced on UNO from 67% to 21% with the same example.
* @ref premade_commands "Premade terminal commands". It can be useful when you want to create a system from the ground up as quickly as
possible. For this reason, some premade terminal commands are available, you can add them to the API-tree with
a macro. Of course, you can select which one you need. This is totally optional you can implement your own versions.
