This section is for those fearless terminal ninjas who want to contribute to improving this system. First of all, we want to say a huge **thank you** for taking the time to make this software better and better!

To ensure that this shared adventure is a fun and productive challenge for everyone, we have a few simple guidelines:  

- **Be respectful and constructive** – Everyone starts somewhere, and we value all contributions, whether big or small. Keep discussions friendly and helpful.  
- **Clear and concise communication** – When reporting issues or submitting code, provide useful details that make it easy for others to understand and help.  
- **Follow the coding style** – Consistency is key. Try to adhere to existing conventions in the project to keep the codebase clean and maintainable.  
- **Write meaningful commit messages** – A good commit message helps others understand *why* a change was made, not just *what* changed.  
- **Be open to feedback** – Code reviews aren’t about criticism; they’re about making the project stronger. Let’s help each other improve!  
- **Keep it fun!** – At the end of the day, we’re all here to learn, build cool things, and collaborate. Let’s make this a positive space for everyone.  

### Necessary Tools

Now that we’ve got that covered, let’s dive in! To start developing, you’ll need a few extra tools:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - Any Git client works, but we recommend [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - We love this code editor
- [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/) - This builds the whole html documentation. You will need at least __version 1.9.5__
