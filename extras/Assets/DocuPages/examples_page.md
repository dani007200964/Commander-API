## Commander-API & Shellminator: A Perfect Duo for Embedded Terminals

Commander-API has been developed alongside Shellminator for many years. Together, these two software packages allow you to create an interactive terminal on low-power processors. While both projects work independently, documenting the same features twice would have been redundant. Thatâ€™s why the documentation for Commander-API can be found within the Shellminator documentation.
