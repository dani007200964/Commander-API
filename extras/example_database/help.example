// Necessary includes

++--GLOBAL_VARIABLES--++

// We have to create an object from Commander class.
Commander commander;

// We have to create the prototypes functions for our commands.
// The arguments have to be the same for all command functions.
void cat_func( char *args, Stream *response, void* parrent );
void dog_func( char *args, Stream *response, void* parrent );

// To tell Commander how many commands we have, it is necessary
// to create an array, that holds some data that represents our
// commands. The type of this array must be Commander::API_t.
// To simplify the command registration, there is a macro called
// apiElement. This macro helps to add command data to this array.
// -The first argument is the name of the command. Commander will
//  search the commands by its name.
// -The second argument is the description for the command.
//  If you use the help command, or '?' character after the command
//  name, Commander will respond  with its description.
// -The third argument is the wrapper function, that has been defined
//  in the previous step.
Commander::API_t API_tree[] = {
    apiElement( "cat", "Description for cat command.", cat_func ),
    apiElement( "dog", "Description for dog command.", dog_func )
};

++--SETUP--++

// There is an option to attach a debug channel to Commander.
// It can be handy to find any problems during the initialization
// phase. In this example, we will use {{ channel }} for this.
commander.attachDebugChannel( &{{ channel }} );

// At start, Commander does not know anything about our commands.
// We have to attach the API_tree array from the previous steps
// to Commander to work properly.
commander.attachTree( API_tree );

// After we attached the API_tree, Commander has to initialize
// itself for the fastest runtime possible. It creates a balanced
// binary tree from the API_tree to boost the search speed.
// This part uses some recursion, to make the code space small.
// But recursion is a bit stack hungry, so please initialize
// Commander at the beginning of your code to prevent stack-overlow.
commander.init();

{{ channel }}.println();
{{ channel }}.println( "---- Init Finished ----" );
{{ channel }}.println();

// Let's try the help command. It will list out all the available commands.
{{ channel }}.println( "Executing 'help' command:" );
commander.execute( "help", &{{ channel }} );
{{ channel }}.println();

// If more information is needed, 'help -d' can be used.
// -d stands for description.
{{ channel }}.println( "Executing 'help -d' command:" );
commander.execute( "help -d", &{{ channel }} );
{{ channel }}.println();

// If you want to get fancy, you can enable text formatting.
// It will only work with VT100 compatible terminal emulators
// like PuTTY. Sadly Arduino Serial Monitor does not support
// this kind of magic...
commander.enableFormatting();
{{ channel }}.println( "Executing 'help -d' command with formatting enabled:" );
commander.execute( "help -d", &{{ channel }} );
