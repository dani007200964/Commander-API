++--SETUP--++

// There is an option to attach a debug channel to Commander.
// It can be handy to find any problems during the initialization
// phase. In this example, we will use {{ channel }} for this.
commander.attachDebugChannel( &{{ channel }} );

// At start, Commander does not know anything about our commands.
// We have to attach the API_tree array from the previous steps
// to Commander to work properly.
commander.attachTree( API_tree );

// After we attached the API_tree, Commander has to initialize
// itself for the fastest runtime possible. It creates a balanced
// binary tree from the API_tree to boost the search speed.
// This part uses some recursion, to make the code space small.
// But recursion is a bit stack hungry, so please initialize
// Commander at the beginning of your code to prevent stack-overlow.
commander.init();

{{ channel }}.println();
{{ channel }}.println( "---- Init Finished ----" );
{{ channel }}.println();

// At this point, Commander is initialized and functional, so let's try it.
// To execute a command, we have to use the execute command. Let's try
// the dog command.
{{ channel }}.println( "Executing 'neofetch' command:" );
commander.execute( "neofetch", &{{ channel }} );
{{ channel }}.println();
