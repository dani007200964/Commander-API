// -The first argument is the name of the command. Commander will
//  search the commands by its name.
// -The second argument is the description for the command.
//  If you use the help command, or '?' character after the command
//  name, Commander will respond  with its description.
// -The third argument is the wrapper function, that has been defined
//  in the previous step.
